The PDF has screenshots I'm sure theres other ways to do this but this has worked for us the best so far. This can be adapted for other software that has multi files and folders as part its installation. 

Documentation for Adobe Software 2025 Deployment Using PowerShell and PDQ Connect
 
## Overview
This document provides detailed instructions for deploying Adobe Software 2025 silently using a PowerShell script through PDQ Connect. The process includes downloading a prepared .zip file, verifying its availability, extracting its contents, executing a silent install, and cleaning up temporary files.

**Intended Audience**
- IT Administrators
- System Deployment Engineers
- Support Technicians using PDQ Connect for software distribution

**Requirements**
- PDQ Connect Agent installed on target devices
- Administrative access to PDQ Connect portal
- `Adobe2025.zip` package prepared with a `Build\setup.exe` structure
- PowerShell 5.1 or newer installed on target devices

## Deployment Components
1. Files Needed Ex `Adobe2025.zip`: Must contain at least the Build folder with setup.exe and related installation files. This zip file is download after create an Adobe Package using the admin console. 
2. Script Purpose

This script automates the following tasks:
- Ensures the .zip archive is available and unlocked.
- Extracts the archive to a temporary directory.
- Searches for setup.exe in case folder structures differ.
- Runs the Photoshop installer silently.
- Cleans up extracted temporary files.

## Script Breakdown

**Configuration Variables**
```powershell
$ZipPath = "C:\\Temp\\PDQ_AdobeInstall\\Adobe2025.zip"
$UnzipPath = "$env:TEMP\\Adobe2025"
$InstallerPath = "$UnzipPath\\Build\\setup.exe"
```
**Defines paths for:**

- ZIP file location after copying
- Temporary extraction location
- Default installer location

**Please read the PDF for directions**

**Purpose:**
- Repeatedly attempts to open the file to verify it is not locked by another process (e.g., antivirus or copy operation).
- Retries up to 30 times, waiting 2 seconds between tries.
 
Step-by-Step Script Execution

**Step 1: Ensure ZIP File Exists**
```powershell
if (-Not (Test-Path $ZipPath)) {
    throw "ZIP file not found at: $ZipPath"
}
```
If the zip file is missing, the script halts.

**Step 2: Wait Until ZIP is Unlocked**
```powershell
Write-Output "Waiting for ZIP file to unlock..."
Wait-ForFileUnlock -FilePath $ZipPath
Prevents extraction failures caused by incomplete downloads or copy operations.
```
**Step 3: Extract the ZIP File**
```powershell
Write-Output "Unzipping Photoshop package..."
Expand-Archive -Path $ZipPath -DestinationPath $UnzipPath -Force
Extracts all files into a clean temporary folder. -Force overwrites if a previous attempt left remnants.
```
**Step 4: Validate Setup.exe Existence**
```
if (-Not (Test-Path $InstallerPath)) {
    Write-Output "Expected installer not found at $InstallerPath â€” scanning..."
    $foundSetup = Get-ChildItem -Path $UnzipPath -Recurse -Filter "setup.exe" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object -First 1
    if ($null -eq $foundSetup) {
        throw "Extraction failed and installer could not be found anywhere under $UnzipPath"
    } else {
        $InstallerPath = $foundSetup.FullName
        Write-Output "Found installer at $InstallerPath"
    }
}
```
Guarantees the installer is found, even if an unexpected folder structure is present inside the zip.

**Step 5: Launch Photoshop Installer Silently**
```powershell
Write-Output "Running Photoshop installer..."
Start-Process -FilePath $InstallerPath -ArgumentList "--silent" -Wait
Executes setup.exe silently (--silent) and waits for the process to finish.
```
**Step 6: Cleanup Temporary Files**
```powershell
Write-Output "Cleaning up..."
Remove-Item -Path $UnzipPath -Recurse -Force
Deletes the temporary extracted folder to conserve disk space.
 ```

## Uploading to PDQ Connect

1.	Create New App in PDQ Connect.
2.	**Upload** `Adobe2025.zip` to `C:\Temp\PDQ_AdobeInstall` using an Install Step or File Copy Step.
3.	Add a PowerShell Step with the script above. (Make sure to import PS not copy and paste)
4.	Set Run As to Local System.
5.	Save and Deploy to the appropriate device collections.

### Troubleshooting Tips

**Symptom	Possible Cause	Resolution**

Script fails at file check	Incorrect ZIP path	Confirm $ZipPath matches deployment folder
Setup.exe not found	Wrong ZIP structure	Update script to locate setup.exe dynamically (already included)
Installer launches UI	Incorrect or missing silent argument	Ensure `--silent` is supported in your Photoshop package
Timeout waiting for ZIP	Copy/upload incomplete	Increase copy time or validate source integrity

**Notes**
- Ensure that the `PhotoShop2025.zip` package includes the complete installer.
- Photoshop packages created with Adobe Admin Console (Shared Device Licensing) typically support silent installs.
- Test on a small batch of devices before large-scale deployment.

**Conclusion**

This script is designed to robustly handle various real-world scenarios encountered during automated deployment, minimizing errors and manual intervention.
